### What is going on?

This is a fake demo project of a user interface for a Drones & Eccomerce intergration

### How does it work?

This uses the patent pending "Super Cool Framework™️", it makes a call to scfServer.js to the files.
Where the json files for each are processed through the system into html.
This gets joined into the final html for the page.
In turn, this page is sent back to the client, where it is stored to be ran in a single page web environment.
